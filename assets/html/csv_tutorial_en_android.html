<h1>How to build .csv file for import?</h1>
<p>
    CSV file format is very simple: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">wikipedia</a></br>
    It's a text file that consists of coma (or semicolon) separated fields organised in lines.</br>
    Each line should represent one object (library entry), like this:</br>
    </br></br>
    "Green apple";"100";"g";"46";"12.1";"0.4";"0.4"</br>
    "Red apple";"100";"g";"47";"12.1";"0.4";"0.4"</br>
    </br></br>
    All values must be in quotes ("{content}").</br>
    </br></br>
    You can have as many lines as you like. The best way would be to prepare input file in spread
    sheet and export to .csv. Make sure that you wrap all values in "" and that you user semicolon
    (;) as separator!.</br>
    You can also add few items to the library manually and simple export it to see how it looks
    like:)</br>
    </br></br>
    Columns are:</br>
    1 - name (string)</br>
    2 - amount in the described entry (100 by default)</br>
    3 - unit of described entry (g - grams by default)</br>
    4 - kilocalories in described entry</br>
    5 - amount of carbs in described unit in grams</br>
    6 - amount of fat in described unit in grams</br>
    7 - amount of protein in described unit in grams</br>
    </br></br>
    File must not have a column row!</br>
    </br></br>
    Good luck!</br>
